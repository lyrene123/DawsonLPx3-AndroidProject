LPx3 is an Android application designed for students at Dawson College. The application features a number of helpful features for students, all easily accessible from the drawer menu. LPx3 offers some functionality that connects with the FriendFinder05 website.

* Class cancellations: View information about class cancellations as they are posted on the Dawson College website. Check which of your friends are registered for a cancelled class.

* Find friends: View a list of all your friends you've registered on the FriendFinder05 website. Clicking on a friend's name will display information about where they are.
* Who is free?: Find out which friends are on their breaks! Select a day (Monday to Friday) and a range of time, and the app will check which of your FriendFinder05 friends are out of class. Clicking a friend's name lets you send them an email.
